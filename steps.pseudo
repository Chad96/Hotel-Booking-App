Step 1: Initialize the Project
    Set up the React project:
    Create a new React project named "Hotel Booking App."
    Install all the required libraries, including React, Redux, React Router, and Firebase.
    Set up a Git repository for version control to track changes and collaborate.


Step 2: Set Up Firebase
    Configure Firebase services:
    Set up Firebase Authentication to allow users to register and log in.
    Configure Firestore as the database to store hotel accommodations, bookings, and user data.
    Set up Firebase Storage for handling image uploads, such as hotel photos.


Step 3: Design and Plan the Application
    Plan the app's design and structure:
    Use Figma or another design tool to create wireframes and plan the user interface (UI/UX).
    Design the database structure in Firestore, determining how to store and organize data.
    Plan the app’s navigation and routing, deciding how users will move through the app.


Step 4: Create Reusable Components
    Develop key components:
    Create a Header component for navigation that will be used across the app.
    Design a Footer component with links and additional information.
    Build an AccommodationCard component to display hotel details like photos, pricing, and amenities.
    Develop a BookingForm component for users to select dates, rooms, and guests.
    Create a Profile component for users to manage their accounts.
    Implement an AdminPanel for admins to manage hotel listings and bookings.

 
Step 5: Implement User Authentication
    Handle user accounts:
    Implement a registration feature allowing users to sign up using Firebase Authentication.
    Develop a login system for users to access their accounts.
    Protect certain routes in the app, ensuring only authenticated users can access specific pages.
    Create a profile management section where users can view and update their details.


Step 6: Manage Accommodations
    Implement accommodation management:
    Enable admins to add new accommodations with details like room type, price, and availability.
    Display a list of available accommodations for users to browse.
    Allow admins to update or delete accommodation details.
    Add search and sorting features to help users find accommodations based on criteria like location and price.
    Implement a feature allowing users to save accommodations to a favorites list.


Step 7: Implement Booking Functionality
    Enable users to book accommodations:
    Create a booking form for users to select check-in/check-out dates and the number of rooms.
    Implement booking confirmation, storing the booking details in Firestore.
    Integrate a payment gateway to handle payments for bookings.


Step 8: Develop the Admin Panel
    Build admin tools:
    Set up an admin login system for secure access to the admin panel.
    Allow admins to manage reservations by approving, modifying, or canceling bookings.
    Provide tools for admins to update room availability, pricing, and descriptions.


Step 9: Manage State with Redux
    Implement state management:
    Set up Redux to manage the global state of the application.
    Define actions and reducers for managing CRUD operations and other state changes.
    Connect the app’s components to the Redux store to ensure they reflect the current state.


Step 10: Ensure Responsiveness and Accessibility
    Make the app user-friendly:
    Apply responsive design techniques to ensure the app works well on all devices and screen sizes.
    Implement accessibility features, such as keyboard navigation and screen reader support, to make the app usable for all users.


Step 11: Optimize and Secure the App
    Focus on performance and security:
    Optimize the app’s performance by improving load times and ensuring a smooth user experience.
    Implement data privacy measures to protect user information and comply with legal requirements.
    Secure the app by protecting routes and ensuring that transactions and user data are safe.
    Plan for scalability so the app can handle a growing number of users and data.


Step 12: Deploy and Document the App
    Finalize and share the project:
    Deploy the app to a hosting platform like Firebase Hosting or Vercel.
    Document the project thoroughly, including detailed instructions in a README file on GitHub.
    Submit the project by sharing the GitHub repository link with your mentor.
